33:1 and the lord said unto moses, depart, and go up hence, thou and
the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of egypt, unto
the land which i sware unto abraham, to isaac, and to jacob, saying,
unto thy seed will i give it: 33:2 and i will send an angel before
thee; and i will drive out the canaanite, the amorite, and the
hittite, and the perizzite, the hivite, and the jebusite: 33:3 unto a
land flowing with milk and honey: for i will not go up in the midst of
thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest i consume thee in the
way.

33:4 and when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and
no man did put on him his ornaments.

33:5 for the lord had said unto moses, say unto the children of
israel, ye are a stiffnecked people: i will come up into the midst of
thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy
ornaments from thee, that i may know what to do unto thee.

33:6 and the children of israel stripped themselves of their ornaments
by the mount horeb.

33:7 and moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp,
afar off from the camp, and called it the tabernacle of the
congregation. and it came to pass, that every one which sought the
lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was
without the camp.

33:8 and it came to pass, when moses went out unto the tabernacle,
that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and
looked after moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.

33:9 and it came to pass, as moses entered into the tabernacle, the
cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and
the lord talked with moses.

33:10 and all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle
door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent
door.

33:11 and the lord spake unto moses face to face, as a man speaketh
unto his friend. and he turned again into the camp: but his servant
joshua, the son of nun, a young man, departed not out of the
tabernacle.

33:12 and moses said unto the lord, see, thou sayest unto me, bring up
this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with
me. yet thou hast said, i know thee by name, and thou hast also found
grace in my sight.

33:13 now therefore, i pray thee, if i have found grace in thy sight,
shew me now thy way, that i may know thee, that i may find grace in
thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.

33:14 and he said, my presence shall go with thee, and i will give
thee rest.

33:15 and he said unto him, if thy presence go not with me, carry us
not up hence.

33:16 for wherein shall it be known here that i and thy people have
found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so
shall we be separated, i and thy people, from all the people that are
upon the face of the earth.

33:17 and the lord said unto moses, i will do this thing also that
thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and i know
thee by name.

33:18 and he said, i beseech thee, shew me thy glory.

33:19 and he said, i will make all my goodness pass before thee, and i
will proclaim the name of the lord before thee; and will be gracious
to whom i will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom i will shew
mercy.

33:20 and he said, thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man
see me, and live.

33:21 and the lord said, behold, there is a place by me, and thou
shalt stand upon a rock: 33:22 and it shall come to pass, while my
glory passeth by, that i will put thee in a clift of the rock, and
will cover thee with my hand while i pass by: 33:23 and i will take
away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall
not be seen.

34:1 and the lord said unto moses, hew thee two tables of stone like
unto the first: and i will write upon these tables the words that were
in the first tables, which thou brakest.

34:2 and be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto
mount sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.

34:3 and no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen
throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before
that mount.

34:4 and he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and moses
rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount sinai, as the
lord had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.

34:5 and the lord descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,
and proclaimed the name of the lord.

34:6 and the lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, the lord, the
lord god, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in
goodness and truth, 34:7 keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving
iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear
the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,
and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth
generation.

34:8 and moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and
worshipped.

34:9 and he said, if now i have found grace in thy sight, o lord, let
my lord, i pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and
pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.

34:10 and he said, behold, i make a covenant: before all thy people i
will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in
any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work
of the lord: for it is a terrible thing that i will do with thee.

34:11 observe thou that which i command thee this day: behold, i drive
out before thee the amorite, and the canaanite, and the hittite, and
the perizzite, and the hivite, and the jebusite.

34:12 take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the
inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in
the midst of thee: 34:13 but ye shall destroy their altars, break
their images, and cut down their groves: 34:14 for thou shalt worship
no other god: for the lord, whose name is jealous, is a jealous god:
34:15 lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and
they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods,
and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; 34:16 and thou take
of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring
after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.

34:17 thou shalt make thee no molten gods.

34:18 the feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. seven days thou
shalt eat unleavened bread, as i commanded thee, in the time of the
month abib: for in the month abib thou camest out from egypt.

34:19 all that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among
thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.

34:20 but the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and
if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. all the
firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. and none shall appear before
me empty.

34:21 six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt
rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.

34:22 and thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of
wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.

34:23 thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the
lord god, the god of israel.

34:24 for i will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy
borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up
to appear before the lord thy god thrice in the year.

34:25 thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;
neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto
the morning.

34:26 the first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto
the house of the lord thy god. thou shalt not seethe a kid in his
mother's milk.

34:27 and the lord said unto moses, write thou these words: for after
the tenor of these words i have made a covenant with thee and with
israel.

34:28 and he was there with the lord forty days and forty nights; he
did neither eat bread, nor drink water. and he wrote upon the tables
the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.

34:29 and it came to pass, when moses came down from mount sinai with
the two tables of testimony in moses' hand, when he came down from the
mount, that moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he
talked with him.

34:30 and when aaron and all the children of israel saw moses, behold,
the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.

34:31 and moses called unto them; and aaron and all the rulers of the
congregation returned unto him: and moses talked with them.

34:32 and afterward all the children of israel came nigh: and he gave
them in commandment all that the lord had spoken with him in mount
sinai.

34:33 and till moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his
face.

34:34 but when moses went in before the lord to speak with him, he
took the vail off, until he came out. and he came out, and spake unto
the children of israel that which he was commanded.

34:35 and the children of israel saw the face of moses, that the skin
of moses' face shone: and moses put the vail upon his face again,
until he went in to speak with him.

35:1 and moses gathered all the congregation of the children of israel
together, and said unto them, these are the words which the lord hath
commanded, that ye should do them.

35:2 six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall
be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the lord: whosoever doeth
work therein shall be put to death.

35:3 ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the
sabbath day.

35:4 and moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of
israel, saying, this is the thing which the lord commanded, saying,
35:5 take ye from among you an offering unto the lord: whosoever is of
a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the lord; gold, and
silver, and brass, 35:6 and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
linen, and goats' hair, 35:7 and rams' skins dyed red, and badgers'
skins, and shittim wood, 35:8 and oil for the light, and spices for
anointing oil, and for the sweet incense, 35:9 and onyx stones, and
stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.

35:10 and every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that
the lord hath commanded; 35:11 the tabernacle, his tent, and his
covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his
sockets, 35:12 the ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat,
and the vail of the covering, 35:13 the table, and his staves, and all
his vessels, and the shewbread, 35:14 the candlestick also for the
light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light,
35:15 and the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil,
and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in
of the tabernacle, 35:16 the altar of burnt offering, with his brasen
grate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot, 35:17
the hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the
hanging for the door of the court, 35:18 the pins of the tabernacle,
and the pins of the court, and their cords, 35:19 the cloths of
service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for aaron
the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's
office.

35:20 and all the congregation of the children of israel departed from
the presence of moses.

35:21 and they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every
one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the lord's offering
to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his
service, and for the holy garments.

35:22 and they came, both men and women, as many as were willing
hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets,
all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of
gold unto the lord.

35:23 and every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and
scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and
badgers' skins, brought them.

35:24 every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought
the lord's offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood
for any work of the service, brought it.

35:25 and all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their
hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of
purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.

35:26 and all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun
goats' hair.

35:27 and the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for
the ephod, and for the breastplate; 35:28 and spice, and oil for the
light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.

35:29 the children of israel brought a willing offering unto the lord,
every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all
manner of work, which the lord had commanded to be made by the hand of
moses.

35:30 and moses said unto the children of israel, see, the lord hath
called by name bezaleel the son of uri, the son of hur, of the tribe
of judah; 35:31 and he hath filled him with the spirit of god, in
wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of
workmanship; 35:32 and to devise curious works, to work in gold, and
in silver, and in brass, 35:33 and in the cutting of stones, to set
them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.

35:34 and he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and
aholiab, the son of ahisamach, of the tribe of dan.

35:35 them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of
work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the
embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen,
and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that
devise cunning work.

36:1 then wrought bezaleel and aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in
whom the lord put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all
manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that
the lord had commanded.

36:2 and moses called bezaleel and aholiab, and every wise hearted
man, in whose heart the lord had put wisdom, even every one whose
heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: 36:3 and they
received of moses all the offering, which the children of israel had
brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it
withal. and they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.

36:4 and all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary,
came every man from his work which they made; 36:5 and they spake unto
moses, saying, the people bring much more than enough for the service
of the work, which the lord commanded to make.

36:6 and moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed
throughout the camp, saying, let neither man nor woman make any more
work for the offering of the sanctuary. so the people were restrained
from bringing.

36:7 for the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make
it, and too much.

36:8 and every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of
the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and
purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.

36:9 the length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the
breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.

36:10 and he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other
five curtains he coupled one unto another.

36:11 and he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the
selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of
another curtain, in the coupling of the second.

36:12 fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in
the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the
loops held one curtain to another.

36:13 and he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one
unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.

36:14 and he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the
tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.

36:15 the length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was
the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.

36:16 and he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by
themselves.

36:17 and he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain
in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain
which coupleth the second.

36:18 and he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together,
that it might be one.

36:19 and he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and
a covering of badgers' skins above that.

36:20 and he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing
up.

36:21 the length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board
one cubit and a half.

36:22 one board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus
did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

36:23 and he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the
south side southward: 36:24 and forty sockets of silver he made under
the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and
two sockets under another board for his two tenons.

36:25 and for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the
north corner, he made twenty boards, 36:26 and their forty sockets of
silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another
board.

36:27 and for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.

36:28 and two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the
two sides.

36:29 and they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head
thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.

36:30 and there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen
sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.

36:31 and he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one
side of the tabernacle, 36:32 and five bars for the boards of the
other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the
tabernacle for the sides westward.

36:33 and he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the
one end to the other.

36:34 and he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of
gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.

36:35 and he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.

36:36 and he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid
them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four
sockets of silver.

36:37 and he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and
purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework; 36:38 and
the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their
chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of
brass.

37:1 and bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half
was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a
cubit and a half the height of it: 37:2 and he overlaid it with pure
gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about.

37:3 and he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four
corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings
upon the other side of it.

37:4 and he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.

37:5 and he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to
bear the ark.

37:6 and he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half
was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof.

37:7 and he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece made
he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat; 37:8 one cherub on the end
on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out of
the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof.

37:9 and the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered
with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another;
even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims.

37:10 and he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the length
thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the
height thereof: 37:11 and he overlaid it with pure gold, and made
thereunto a crown of gold round about.

37:12 also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about;
and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.

37:13 and he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon
the four corners that were in the four feet thereof.

37:14 over against the border were the rings, the places for the
staves to bear the table.

37:15 and he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
gold, to bear the table.

37:16 and he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes,
and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, of pure
gold.

37:17 and he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he
the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and
his flowers, were of the same: 37:18 and six branches going out of the
sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side
thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side
thereof: 37:19 three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one
branch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in
another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches
going out of the candlestick.

37:20 and in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his
knops, and his flowers: 37:21 and a knop under two branches of the
same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two
branches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it.

37:22 their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was
one beaten work of pure gold.

37:23 and he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his
snuffdishes, of pure gold.

37:24 of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels
thereof.

37:25 and he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of it
was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was foursquare; and two
cubits was the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same.

37:26 and he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the
sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a
crown of gold round about.

37:27 and he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by
the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for
the staves to bear it withal.

37:28 and he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
gold.

37:29 and he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of
sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.

38:1 and he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five
cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; it
was foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof.

38:2 and he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the
horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.

38:3 and he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the
shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the
vessels thereof made he of brass.

38:4 and he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the
compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.

38:5 and he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass,
to be places for the staves.

38:6 and he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
brass.

38:7 and he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar,
to bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with boards.

38:8 and he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass, of
the lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled at the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

38:9 and he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings
of the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred cubits: 38:10 their
pillars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty; the hooks of the
pillars and their fillets were of silver.

38:11 and for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits,
their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty; the

38:12 and for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their

38:13 and for the east side eastward fifty cubits.

38:14 the hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits;
their pillars three, and their sockets three.

38:15 and for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that
hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their

38:16 all the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined
linen.

38:17 and the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the
pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of their
chapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted
with silver.

38:18 and the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, of
blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty
cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits,
answerable to the hangings of the court.

38:19 and their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four;
their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and their
fillets of silver.

38:20 and all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round
about, were of brass.

38:21 this is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of
testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of moses,
for the service of the levites, by the hand of ithamar, son to aaron
the priest.

38:22 and bezaleel the son uri, the son of hur, of the tribe of judah,
made all that the lord commanded moses.

38:23 and with him was aholiab, son of ahisamach, of the tribe of dan,
an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in
purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.

38:24 all the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of
the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine
talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the
sanctuary.

38:25 and the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation
was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore
and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 38:26 a bekah
for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the
sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years
old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five
hundred and fifty men.

38:27 and of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of
the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the
hundred talents, a talent for a socket.

38:28 and of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he
made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted
them.

38:29 and the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two
thousand and four hundred shekels.

38:30 and therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle
of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate for
it, and all the vessels of the altar, 38:31 and the sockets of the
court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins
of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.

39:1 and of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of
service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments
for aaron; as the lord commanded moses.

39:2 and he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and
fine twined linen.

39:3 and they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into
wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet,
and in the fine linen, with cunning work.

39:4 they made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the
two edges was it coupled together.

39:5 and the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the
same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and
scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the lord commanded moses.

39:6 and they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven,
as signets are graven, with the names of the children of israel.

39:7 and he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should
be stones for a memorial to the children of israel; as the lord
commanded moses.

39:8 and he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the
ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

39:9 it was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was
the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.

39:10 and they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a
sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.

39:11 and the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.

39:12 and the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

39:13 and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were
inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.

39:14 and the stones were according to the names of the children of
israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a
signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.

39:15 and they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of
wreathen work of pure gold.

39:16 and they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put
the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.

39:17 and they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on
the ends of the breastplate.

39:18 and the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the
two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before
it.

39:19 and they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of
the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the
ephod inward.

39:20 and they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two
sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against
the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.

39:21 and they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of
the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious
girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from
the ephod; as the lord commanded moses.

39:22 and he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.

39:23 and there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of
an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not
rend.

39:24 and they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue,
and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.

39:25 and they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the
pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the
pomegranates; 39:26 a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a
pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the
lord commanded moses.

39:27 and they made coats of fine linen of woven work for aaron, and
for his sons, 39:28 and a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of
fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen, 39:29 and a
girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of
needlework; as the lord commanded moses.

39:30 and they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and
wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, holiness
to the lord.

39:31 and they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon
the mitre; as the lord commanded moses.

39:32 thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the
congregation finished: and the children of israel did according to all
that the lord commanded moses, so did they.

39:33 and they brought the tabernacle unto moses, the tent, and all
his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and
his sockets, 39:34 and the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the
covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering, 39:35 the
ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat,
39:36 the table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread, 39:37
the pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to
be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,
39:38 and the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet
incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door, 39:39 the brasen
altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, the
laver and his foot, 39:40 the hangings of the court, his pillars, and
his sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his
pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the
tent of the congregation, 39:41 the cloths of service to do service in
the holy place, and the holy garments for aaron the priest, and his
sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.

39:42 according to all that the lord commanded moses, so the children
of israel made all the work.

39:43 and moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done
it as the lord had commanded, even so had they done it: and moses
blessed them.

40:1 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 40:2 on the first day of
the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the
congregation.

40:3 and thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover
the ark with the vail.

40:4 and thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things
that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the
candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.

40:5 and thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the
ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the
tabernacle.

40:6 and thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the
door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

40:7 and thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation
and the altar, and shalt put water therein.

40:8 and thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the
hanging at the court gate.

40:9 and thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle,
and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels
thereof: and it shall be holy.

40:10 and thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all
his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most
holy.

40:11 and thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.

40:12 and thou shalt bring aaron and his sons unto the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.

40:13 and thou shalt put upon aaron the holy garments, and anoint him,
and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.

40:14 and thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: 40:15
and thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that
they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing
shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their
generations.

40:16 thus did moses: according to all that the lord commanded him, so
did he.

40:17 and it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on
the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.

40:18 and moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,
and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared
up his pillars.

40:19 and he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the
covering of the tent above upon it; as the lord commanded moses.

40:20 and he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the
staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 40:21
and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the
covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the lord commanded
moses.

40:22 and he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the
side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.

40:23 and he set the bread in order upon it before the lord; as the
lord had commanded moses.

40:24 and he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over
against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.

40:25 and he lighted the lamps before the lord; as the lord commanded
moses.

40:26 and he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation
before the vail: 40:27 and he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the lord
commanded moses.

40:28 and he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.

40:29 and he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the
tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the
burnt offering and the meat offering; as the lord commanded moses.

40:30 and he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and
the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.

40:31 and moses and aaron and his sons washed their hands and their
feet thereat: 40:32 when they went into the tent of the congregation,
and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the lord
commanded moses.

40:33 and he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the
altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. so moses finished the
work.

40:34 then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory
of the lord filled the tabernacle.

40:35 and moses was not able to enter into the tent of the
congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the
lord filled the tabernacle.

40:36 and when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the
children of israel went onward in all their journeys: 40:37 but if the
cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it
was taken up.

40:38 for the cloud of the lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and
fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of israel,
throughout all their journeys.




the third book of moses:  called leviticus


1:1 and the lord called unto moses, and spake unto him out of the
tabernacle of the congregation, saying, 1:2 speak unto the children of
israel, and say unto them, if any man of you bring an offering unto
the lord, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the
herd, and of the flock.

1:3 if his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a
male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at
the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the lord.

1:4 and he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and
it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.

1:5 and he shall kill the bullock before the lord: and the priests,
aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round
about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation.

1:6 and he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.

1:7 and the sons of aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar,
and lay the wood in order upon the fire: 1:8 and the priests, aaron's
sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the
wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: 1:9 but his inwards
and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on
the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a
sweet savour unto the lord.

1:10 and if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of
the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without
blemish.

1:11 and he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before
the lord: and the priests, aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood
round about upon the altar.

1:12 and he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat:
and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire
which is upon the altar: 1:13 but he shall wash the inwards and the
legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon
the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a
sweet savour unto the lord.

1:14 and if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the lord be of
fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young
pigeons.

1:15 and the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his
head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung
out at the side of the altar: 1:16 and he shall pluck away his crop
with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by
the place of the ashes: 1:17 and he shall cleave it with the wings
thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it
upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt
sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the lord.

2:1 and when any will offer a meat offering unto the lord, his
offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and
put frankincense thereon: 2:2 and he shall bring it to aaron's sons
the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour
thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof;
and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an
offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the lord: 2:3 and the
remnant of the meat offering shall be aaron's and his sons': it is a
thing most holy of the offerings of the lord made by fire.

2:4 and if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the
oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or
unleavened wafers anointed with oil.

2:5 and if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be
of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.

2:6 thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat
offering.

2:7 and if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it
shall be made of fine flour with oil.

2:8 and thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these
things unto the lord: and when it is presented unto the priest, he
shall bring it unto the altar.

2:9 and the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial
thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by
fire, of a sweet savour unto the lord.

2:10 and that which is left of the meat offering shall be aaron's and
his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the lord made
by fire.

2:11 no meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the lord, shall be
made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any
offering of the lord made by fire.

2:12 as for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto
the lord: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.

2:13 and every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with
salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy god to
be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt
offer salt.

2:14 and if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the
lord, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green
ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.

2:15 and thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it
is a meat offering.

2:16 and the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten
corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense
thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the lord.

3:1 and if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer
it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it
without blemish before the lord.

3:2 and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill
it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and aaron's sons
the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.

3:3 and he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an
offering made by fire unto the lord; the fat that covereth the
inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 3:4 and the two
kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the
caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.

3:5 and aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt
sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an
offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the lord.

3:6 and if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the
lord be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without
blemish.

3:7 if he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before
the lord.

3:8 and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill
it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and aaron's sons shall
sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar.

3:9 and he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an
offering made by fire unto the lord; the fat thereof, and the whole
rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that
covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 3:10
and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the
flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he
take away.

3:11 and the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of
the offering made by fire unto the lord.

3:12 and if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the
lord.

3:13 and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before
the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of aaron shall
sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.

3:14 and he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by
fire unto the lord; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat
that is upon the inwards, 3:15 and the two kidneys, and the fat that
is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver,
with the kidneys, it shall he take away.

3:16 and the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of
the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is the
lord's.

3:17 it shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout
all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.

4:1 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 4:2 speak unto the children
of israel, saying, if a soul shall sin through ignorance against any
of the commandments of the lord concerning things which ought not to
be done, and shall do against any of them: 4:3 if the priest that is
anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring
for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish
unto the lord for a sin offering.

4:4 and he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of
the congregation before the lord; and shall lay his hand upon the
bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the lord.

4:5 and the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood,
and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:6 and the priest
shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven
times before the lord, before the vail of the sanctuary.

4:7 and the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the
altar of sweet incense before the lord, which is in the tabernacle of
the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the
bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation.

4:8 and he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the
sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that
is upon the inwards, 4:9 and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon
them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the
kidneys, it shall he take away, 4:10 as it was taken off from the
bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn
them upon the altar of the burnt offering.

4:11 and the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head,
and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, 4:12 even the whole
bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place,
where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire:
where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.

4:13 and if the whole congregation of israel sin through ignorance,
and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done
somewhat against any of the commandments of the lord concerning things
which should not be done, and are guilty; 4:14 when the sin, which
they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall
offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle
of the congregation.

4:15 and the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the
head of the bullock before the lord: and the bullock shall be killed
before the lord.

4:16 and the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's
blood to the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:17 and the priest shall
dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times
before the lord, even before the vail.

4:18 and he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar
which is before the lord, that is in the tabernacle of the
congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the
altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of
the congregation.

4:19 and he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the
altar.

4:20 and he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a
sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an
atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.

4:21 and he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn
him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the
congregation.

4:22 when a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance
against any of the commandments of the lord his god concerning things
which should not be done, and is guilty; 4:23 or if his sin, wherein
he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a
kid of the goats, a male without blemish: 4:24 and he shall lay his
hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they
kill the burnt offering before the lord: it is a sin offering.

4:25 and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with
his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,
and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt
offering.

4:26 and he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the
sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement
for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.

4:27 and if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while
he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the lord
concerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty; 4:28 or
if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall
bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for
his sin which he hath sinned.

4:29 and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and
slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.

4:30 and the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger,
and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall
pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.

4:31 and he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken
away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall
burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the lord; and the
priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.

4:32 and if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a
female without blemish.

4:33 and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and
slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt
offering.

4:34 and the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with
his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,
and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:
4:35 and he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the
lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the
priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made
by fire unto the lord: and the priest shall make an atonement for his
sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.

5:1 and if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a
witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it,
then he shall bear his iniquity.

5:2 or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of
an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of
unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall
be unclean, and guilty.

5:3 or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it
be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he
knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.

5:4 or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do
good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it
be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one
of these.

5:5 and it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things,
that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing: 5:6 and he
shall bring his trespass offering unto the lord for his sin which he
hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats,
for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him
concerning his sin.

5:7 and if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his
trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young
pigeons, unto the lord; one for a sin offering, and the other for a
burnt offering.

5:8 and he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that
which is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his
neck, but shall not divide it asunder: 5:9 and he shall sprinkle of
the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest
of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a
sin offering.

5:10 and he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to
the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin
which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.

5:11 but if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young
pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth
part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil
upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a
sin offering.

5:12 then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take
his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar,
according to the offerings made by fire unto the lord: it is a sin
offering.

5:13 and the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his
sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him:
and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat offering.

5:14 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 5:15 if a soul commit a
trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the lord;
then he shall bring for his trespass unto the lord a ram without
blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver,
after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.

5:16 and he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the
holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the
priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of
the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.

5:17 and if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are
forbidden to be done by the commandments of the lord; though he wist
it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.

5:18 and he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with
thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the
priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance
wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him.

5:19 it is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against
the lord.

6:1 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 6:2 if a soul sin, and
commit a trespass against the lord, and lie unto his neighbour in that
which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken
away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour; 6:3 or have found
that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in
any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein: 6:4 then it shall
be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that
which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully
gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing
which he found, 6:5 or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he
shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part
more thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day
of his trespass offering.

6:6 and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the lord, a ram
without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass
offering, unto the priest: 6:7 and the priest shall make an atonement
for him before the lord: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of
all that he hath done in trespassing therein.

6:8 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 6:9 command aaron and his
sons, saying, this is the law of the burnt offering: it is the burnt
offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the
morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.

6:10 and the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen
breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the
fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall
put them beside the altar.

6:11 and he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and
carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.

6:12 and the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not
be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and
lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the
fat of the peace offerings.

6:13 the fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go
out.

6:14 and this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of aaron shall
offer it before the lord, before the altar.

6:15 and he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat
offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is
upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet
savour, even the memorial of it, unto the lord.

6:16 and the remainder thereof shall aaron and his sons eat: with
unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of
the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.

6:17 it shall not be baken with leaven. i have given it unto them for
their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the
sin offering, and as the trespass offering.

6:18 all the males among the children of aaron shall eat of it. it
shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the
offerings of the lord made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall
be holy.

6:19 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 6:20 this is the offering
of aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the lord in the
day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for
a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof
at night.

6:21 in a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou
shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt
thou offer for a sweet savour unto the lord.

6:22 and the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall
offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the lord; it shall be wholly
burnt.

6:23 for every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it
shall not be eaten.

6:24 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 6:25 speak unto aaron and
to his sons, saying, this is the law of the sin offering: in the place
where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed
before the lord: it is most holy.

6:26 the priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy
place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the
congregation.

6:27 whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when
there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt
wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.

6:28 but the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and
if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed
in water.

6:29 all the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most
holy.

6:30 and no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the
tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place,
shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.

7:1 likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most
holy.

7:2 in the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill
the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round
about upon the altar.

7:3 and he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the
fat that covereth the inwards, 7:4 and the two kidneys, and the fat
that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above
the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away: 7:5 and the priest
shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the
lord: it is a trespass offering.

7:6 every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten
in the holy place: it is most holy.

7:7 as the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one
law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have
it.

7:8 and the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the
priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he
hath offered.

7:9 and all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that
is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's
that offereth it.

7:10 and every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the
sons of aaron have, one as much as another.

7:11 and this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he
shall offer unto the lord.

7:12 if he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the
sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and
unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of
fine flour, fried.

7:13 besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread
with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.

7:14 and of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an
heave offering unto the lord, and it shall be the priest's that
sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.

7:15 and the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for
thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall
not leave any of it until the morning.

7:16 but if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary
offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his
sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:
7:17 but the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day
shall be burnt with fire.

7:18 and if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings
be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither
shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an
abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.

7:19 and the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten;
it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean
shall eat thereof.

7:20 but the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace
offerings, that pertain unto the lord, having his uncleanness upon
him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.

7:21 moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the
uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean
thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which
pertain unto the lord, even that soul shall be cut off from his
people.

7:22 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 7:23 speak unto the
children of israel, saying, ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or
of sheep, or of goat.

7:24 and the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of
that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye
shall in no wise eat of it.

7:25 for whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an
offering made by fire unto the lord, even the soul that eateth it
shall be cut off from his people.

7:26 moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl
or of beast, in any of your dwellings.

7:27 whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that
soul shall be cut off from his people.

7:28 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 7:29 speak unto the
children of israel, saying, he that offereth the sacrifice of his
peace offerings unto the lord shall bring his oblation unto the lord
of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.

7:30 his own hands shall bring the offerings of the lord made by fire,
the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be
waved for a wave offering before the lord.

7:31 and the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast
shall be aaron's and his sons'.

7:32 and the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave
offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.

7:33 he among the sons of aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace
offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.

7:34 for the wave breast and the heave shoulder have i taken of the
children of israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings,
and have given them unto aaron the priest and unto his sons by a
statute for ever from among the children of israel.

7:35 this is the portion of the anointing of aaron, and of the
anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the lord made by fire,
in the day when he presented them to minister unto the lord in the
priest's office; 7:36 which the lord commanded to be given them of the
children of israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for
ever throughout their generations.

7:37 this is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and
of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the
consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; 7:38 which
the lord commanded moses in mount sinai, in the day that he commanded
the children of israel to offer their oblations unto the lord, in the
wilderness of sinai.

8:1 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 8:2 take aaron and his sons
with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for
the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread; 8:3
and gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation.

8:4 and moses did as the lord commanded him; and the assembly was
gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

8:5 and moses said unto the congregation, this is the thing which the
lord commanded to be done.

8:6 and moses brought aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.

8:7 and he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and
clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded
him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him
therewith.

8:8 and he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the
breastplate the urim and the thummim.

8:9 and he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon
his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the
lord commanded moses.

8:10 and moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and
all that was therein, and sanctified them.

8:11 and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed
the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to
sanctify them.

8:12 and he poured of the anointing oil upon aaron's head, and
anointed him, to sanctify him.

8:13 and moses brought aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and
girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the lord
commanded moses.

8:14 and he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and aaron and
his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin
offering.

8:15 and he slew it; and moses took the blood, and put it upon the
horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the
altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified
it, to make reconciliation upon it.

8:16 and he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul
above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and moses burned
it upon the altar.

8:17 but the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt
with fire without the camp; as the lord commanded moses.

8:18 and he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and aaron and his
sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

8:19 and he killed it; and moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar
round about.

8:20 and he cut the ram into pieces; and moses burnt the head, and the
pieces, and the fat.

8:21 and he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and moses burnt
the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet
savour, and an offering made by fire unto the lord; as the lord
commanded moses.

8:22 and he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and aaron
and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

8:23 and he slew it; and moses took of the blood of it, and put it
upon the tip of aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right
hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.

8:24 and he brought aaron's sons, and moses put of the blood upon the
tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and
upon the great toes of their right feet: and moses sprinkled the blood
upon the altar round about.

8:25 and he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon
the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and
their fat, and the right shoulder: 8:26 and out of the basket of
unleavened bread, that was before the lord, he took one unleavened
cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the
fat, and upon the right shoulder: 8:27 and he put all upon aaron's
hands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offering
before the lord.

8:28 and moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the
altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet
savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the lord.

8:29 and moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering
before the lord: for of the ram of consecration it was moses' part; as
the lord commanded moses.

8:30 and moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was
upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon aaron, and upon his garments,
and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and
sanctified aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons'
garments with him.

8:31 and moses said unto aaron and to his sons, boil the flesh at the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the
bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as i commanded, saying,
aaron and his sons shall eat it.

8:32 and that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye
burn with fire.

8:33 and ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at
an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.

8:34 as he hath done this day, so the lord hath commanded to do, to
make an atonement for you.

8:35 therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the
lord, that ye die not: for so i am commanded.

8:36 so aaron and his sons did all things which the lord commanded by
the hand of moses.

9:1 and it came to pass on the eighth day, that moses called aaron and
his sons, and the elders of israel; 9:2 and he said unto aaron, take
thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering,
without blemish, and offer them before the lord.

9:3 and unto the children of israel thou shalt speak, saying, take ye
a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of
the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; 9:4 also a
bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the lord;
and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the lord will appear
unto you.

9:5 and they brought that which moses commanded before the tabernacle
of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood
before the lord.

9:6 and moses said, this is the thing which the lord commanded that ye
should do: and the glory of the lord shall appear unto you.

9:7 and moses said unto aaron, go unto the altar, and offer thy sin
offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself,
and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an
atonement for them; as the lord commanded.

9:8 aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin
offering, which was for himself.

9:9 and the sons of aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped
his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and
poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: 9:10 but the fat, and
the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he
burnt upon the altar; as the lord commanded moses.

9:11 and the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.

9:12 and he slew the burnt offering; and aaron's sons presented unto
him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.

9:13 and they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces
thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.

9:14 and he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the
burnt offering on the altar.

9:15 and he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which
was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for
sin, as the first.

9:16 and he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to
the manner.

9:17 and he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,
and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the
morning.

9:18 he slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace
offerings, which was for the people: and aaron's sons presented unto
him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about, 9:19 and
the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which
covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:
9:20 and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon
the altar: 9:21 and the breasts and the right shoulder aaron waved for
a wave offering before the lord; as moses commanded.

9:22 and aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them,
and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt
offering, and peace offerings.

9:23 and moses and aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation,
and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the lord
appeared unto all the people.

9:24 and there came a fire out from before the lord, and consumed upon
the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people
saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.

10:1 and nadab and abihu, the sons of aaron, took either of them his
censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered
strange fire before the lord, which he commanded them not.

10:2 and there went out fire from the lord, and devoured them, and
they died before the lord.

10:3 then moses said unto aaron, this is it that the lord spake,
saying, i will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all
the people i will be glorified. and aaron held his peace.

10:4 and moses called mishael and elzaphan, the sons of uzziel the
uncle of aaron, and said unto them, come near, carry your brethren
from before the sanctuary out of the camp.

10:5 so they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the
camp; as moses had said.

10:6 and moses said unto aaron, and unto eleazar and unto ithamar, his
sons, uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die,
and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the
whole house of israel, bewail the burning which the lord hath kindled.

10:7 and ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the lord is upon
you. and they did according to the word of moses.

10:8 and the lord spake unto aaron, saying, 10:9 do not drink wine nor
strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the
tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for
ever throughout your generations: 10:10 and that ye may put difference
between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean; 10:11 and that
ye may teach the children of israel all the statutes which the lord
hath spoken unto them by the hand of moses.

10:12 and moses spake unto aaron, and unto eleazar and unto ithamar,
his sons that were left, take the meat offering that remaineth of the
offerings of the lord made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside
the altar: for it is most holy: 10:13 and ye shall eat it in the holy
place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of
the lord made by fire: for so i am commanded.

10:14 and the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean
place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be
thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of
peace offerings of the children of israel.

10:15 the heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the
offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering
before the lord; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a
statute for ever; as the lord hath commanded.

10:16 and moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,
behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with eleazar and ithamar, the
sons of aaron which were left alive, saying, 10:17 wherefore have ye
not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy,
and god hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to
make atonement for them before the lord?  10:18 behold, the blood of
it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have
eaten it in the holy place, as i commanded.

10:19 and aaron said unto moses, behold, this day have they offered
their sin offering and their burnt offering before the lord; and such
things have befallen me: and if i had eaten the sin offering to day,
should it have been accepted in the sight of the lord?  10:20 and when
moses heard that, he was content.

11:1 and the lord spake unto moses and to aaron, saying unto them,
11:2 speak unto the children of israel, saying, these are the beasts
which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.

11:3 whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the
cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.

11:4 nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or
of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the
cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.

11:5 and the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the
hoof; he is unclean unto you.

11:6 and the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the
hoof; he is unclean unto you.

11:7 and the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted,
yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.

11:8 of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not
touch; they are unclean to you.

11:9 these shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath
fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them
shall ye eat.

11:10 and all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the
rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which
is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you: 11:11 they
shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their
flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.

11:12 whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be
an abomination unto you.

11:13 and these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the
fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle,
and the ossifrage, and the ospray, 11:14 and the vulture, and the kite
after his kind; 11:15 every raven after his kind; 11:16 and the owl,
and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, 11:17
and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl, 11:18 and
the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle, 11:19 and the stork,
the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.

11:20 all fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an
abomination unto you.

11:21 yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth
upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon
the earth; 11:22 even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his
kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his
kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.

11:23 but all other flying creeping things, which have four feet,
shall be an abomination unto you.

11:24 and for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the
carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.

11:25 and whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash
his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

11:26 the carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not
clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one
that toucheth them shall be unclean.

11:27 and whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts
that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their
carcase shall be unclean until the even.

11:28 and he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes,
and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.

11:29 these also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things
that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise
after his kind, 11:30 and the ferret, and the chameleon, and the
lizard, and the snail, and the mole.

11:31 these are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth
touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.

11:32 and upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall,
it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or
skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it
must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it
shall be cleansed.

11:33 and every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth,
whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.

11:34 of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh
shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel
shall be unclean.

11:35 and every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth
shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall
be broken down: for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you.

11:36 nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of
water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be
unclean.

11:37 and if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which
is to be sown, it shall be clean.

11:38 but if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their
carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.

11:39 and if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the
carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.

11:40 and he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes,
and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it
shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

11:41 and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be
an abomination; it shall not be eaten.

11:42 whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all
four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that
creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an
abomination.

11:43 ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing
that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them,
that ye should be defiled thereby.

11:44 for i am the lord your god: ye shall therefore sanctify
yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for i am holy: neither shall ye
defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon
the earth.

11:45 for i am the lord that bringeth you up out of the land of egypt,
to be your god: ye shall therefore be holy, for i am holy.

11:46 this is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every
living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that
creepeth upon the earth: 11:47 to make a difference between the
unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the
beast that may not be eaten.

12:1 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 12:2 speak unto the
children of israel, saying, if a woman have conceived seed, and born a
man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days
of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.

12:3 and in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be
circumcised.

12:4 and she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three
and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the
sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.

12:5 but if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two
weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of
her purifying threescore and six days.

12:6 and when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or
for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt
offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering,
unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:
12:7 who shall offer it before the lord, and make an atonement for
her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. this is
the law for her that hath born a male or a female.

12:8 and if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two
turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the
other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for
her, and she shall be clean.

13:1 and the lord spake unto moses and aaron, saying, 13:2 when a man
shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot,
and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he
shall be brought unto aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the
priests: 13:3 and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of
the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the
plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague
of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him
unclean.

13:4 if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in
sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned
white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven
days: 13:5 and the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and,
behold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread
not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:
13:6 and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and,
behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in
the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and
he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

13:7 but if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he
hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of
the priest again.

13:8 and if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the
skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.

13:9 when the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought
unto the priest; 13:10 and the priest shall see him: and, behold, if
the rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white,
and there be quick raw flesh in the rising; 13:11 it is an old leprosy
in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean,
and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.

13:12 and if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy
cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to
his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh; 13:13 then the priest shall
consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he
shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned
white: he is clean.

13:14 but when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.

13:15 and the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be
unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.

13:16 or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he
shall come unto the priest; 13:17 and the priest shall see him: and,
behold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall
pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.

13:18 the flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil,
and is healed, 13:19 and in the place of the boil there be a white
rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be
shewed to the priest; 13:20 and if, when the priest seeth it, behold,
it be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned
white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of
leprosy broken out of the boil.

13:21 but if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white
hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat
dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 13:22 and if it
spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him
unclean: it is a plague.

13:23 but if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is
a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

13:24 or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot
burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot,
somewhat reddish, or white; 13:25 then the priest shall look upon it:
and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it be
in sight deeper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the
burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the
plague of leprosy.

13:26 but if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white
hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but
be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 13:27
and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be
spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him
unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.

13:28 and if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the
skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the
priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the
burning.

13:29 if a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;
13:30 then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in
sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair;
then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a
leprosy upon the head or beard.

13:31 and if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold,
it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black
hair in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of
the scall seven days: 13:32 and in the seventh day the priest shall
look on the plague: and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be
in it no yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the
skin; 13:33 he shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and
the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:
13:34 and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and,
behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper
than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall
wash his clothes, and be clean.

13:35 but if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;
13:36 then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be
spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is
unclean.

13:37 but if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is
black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the
priest shall pronounce him clean.

13:38 if a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright
spots, even white bright spots; 13:39 then the priest shall look: and,
behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish
white; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.

13:40 and the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet
is he clean.

13:41 and he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head
toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.

13:42 and if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white
reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald
forehead.

13:43 then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising
of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald
forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh; 13:44 he
is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him
utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.

13:45 and the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent,
and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and
shall cry, unclean, unclean.

13:46 all the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be
defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall
his habitation be.

13:47 the garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be
a woollen garment, or a linen garment; 13:48 whether it be in the
warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any
thing made of skin; 13:49 and if the plague be greenish or reddish in
the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in
any thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto
the priest: 13:50 and the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut
up it that hath the plague seven days: 13:51 and he shall look on the
plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment,
either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that
is made of skin; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.

13:52 he shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in
woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for
it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.

13:53 and if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not
spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any
thing of skin; 13:54 then the priest shall command that they wash the
thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:
13:55 and the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is
washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and
the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the
fire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.

13:56 and if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark
after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or
out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof: 13:57 and if
it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or
in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that
wherein the plague is with fire.

13:58 and the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of
skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from
them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.

13:59 this is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen
or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to
pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

14:1 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 14:2 this shall be the law
of the leper in the day of his cleansing: he shall be brought unto the
priest: 14:3 and the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the
priest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in
the leper; 14:4 then shall the priest command to take for him that is
to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet,
and hyssop: 14:5 and the priest shall command that one of the birds be
killed in an earthen vessel over running water: 14:6 as for the living
bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the
hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the
bird that was killed over the running water: 14:7 and he shall
sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times,
and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose
into the open field.

14:8 and he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave
off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and
after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of
his tent seven days.

14:9 but it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his
hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he
shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his
flesh in water, and he shall be clean.

14:10 and on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without
blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three
tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and
one log of oil.

14:11 and the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that
is to be made clean, and those things, before the lord, at the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation: 14:12 and the priest shall take
one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of
oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the lord: 14:13 and he
shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering
and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering is
the priest's, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy: 14:14 and
the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and
the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is
to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the
great toe of his right foot: 14:15 and the priest shall take some of
the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand: 14:16
and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his
left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times
before the lord: 14:17 and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand
shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to
be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great
toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering: 14:18
and the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall pour
upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make
an atonement for him before the lord.

14:19 and the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an
atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and
afterward he shall kill the burnt offering: 14:20 and the priest shall
offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar: and the
priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.

14:21 and if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take
one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for
him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat
offering, and a log of oil; 14:22 and two turtledoves, or two young
pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin
offering, and the other a burnt offering.

14:23 and he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto
the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
before the lord.

14:24 and the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and
the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering
before the lord: 14:25 and he shall kill the lamb of the trespass
offering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass
offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to
be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great
toe of his right foot: 14:26 and the priest shall pour of the oil into
the palm of his own left hand: 14:27 and the priest shall sprinkle
with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven
times before the lord: 14:28 and the priest shall put of the oil that
is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be
cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe
of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass
offering: 14:29 and the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand
he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an
atonement for him before the lord.

14:30 and he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young
pigeons, such as he can get; 14:31 even such as he is able to get, the
one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the
meat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is
to be cleansed before the lord.

14:32 this is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose
hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing.

14:33 and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron, saying, 14:34 when
ye be come into the land of canaan, which i give to you for a
possession, and i put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of
your possession; 14:35 and he that owneth the house shall come and
tell the priest, saying, it seemeth to me there is as it were a plague
in the house: 14:36 then the priest shall command that they empty the
house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that
is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go
in to see the house: 14:37 and he shall look on the plague, and,
behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow
strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;
14:38 then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the
house, and shut up the house seven days: 14:39 and the priest shall
come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague
be spread in the walls of the house; 14:40 then the priest shall
command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and
they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city: 14:41 and
he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they
shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an
unclean place: 14:42 and they shall take other stones, and put them in
the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall
plaister the house.

14:43 and if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after
that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the
house, and after it is plaistered; 14:44 then the priest shall come
and look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a
fretting leprosy in the house; it is unclean.

14:45 and he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the
timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry
them forth out of the city into an unclean place.

14:46 moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is
shut up shall be unclean until the even.

14:47 and he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he
that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.

14:48 and if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold,
the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was
plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because
the plague is healed.

14:49 and he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar
wood, and scarlet, and hyssop: 14:50 and he shall kill the one of the
birds in an earthen vessel over running water: 14:51 and he shall take
the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird,
and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water,
and sprinkle the house seven times: 14:52 and he shall cleanse the
house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with
the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and
with the scarlet: 14:53 but he shall let go the living bird out of the
city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it
shall be clean.

14:54 this is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,
14:55 and for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house, 14:56 and for
a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot: 14:57 to teach when
it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.

15:1 and the lord spake unto moses and to aaron, saying, 15:2 speak
unto the children of israel, and say unto them, when any man hath a
running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.

15:3 and this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh
run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his
uncleanness.

15:4 every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and
every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.

15:5 and whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe
himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

15:6 and he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the
issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be
unclean until the even.

15:7 and he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall
wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the
even.

15:8 and if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean; then
he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean
until the even.

15:9 and what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall
be unclean.

15:10 and whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be
unclean until the even: and he that beareth any of those things shall
wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the
even.

15:11 and whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not
rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe
himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

15:12 and the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the issue,
shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.

15:13 and when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he
shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his
clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.

15:14 and on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or
two young pigeons, and come before the lord unto the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the priest: 15:15
and the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering, and the
other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for
him before the lord for his issue.

15:16 and if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he
shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.

15:17 and every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of
copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even.

15:18 the woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation,
they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the
even.

15:19 and if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be
blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her
shall be unclean until the even.

15:20 and every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be
unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean.

15:21 and whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe
himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

15:22 and whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash
his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the
even.

15:23 and if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth,
when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even.

15:24 and if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him,
he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall
be unclean.

15:25 and if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the
time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her
separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as
the days of her separation: she shall be unclean.

15:26 every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be
unto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she sitteth upon
shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation.

15:27 and whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall
wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the
even.

15:28 but if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to
herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.

15:29 and on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or
two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation.

15:30 and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the
other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for
her before the lord for the issue of her uncleanness.

15:31 thus shall ye separate the children of israel from their
uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile
my tabernacle that is among them.

15:32 this is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed
goeth from him, and is defiled therewith; 15:33 and of her that is
sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of
the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.

16:1 and the lord spake unto moses after the death of the two sons of
aaron, when they offered before the lord, and died; 16:2 and the lord
said unto moses, speak unto aaron thy brother, that he come not at all
times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, which
is upon the ark; that he die not: for i will appear in the cloud upon
the mercy seat.

16:3 thus shall aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock
for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.

16:4 he shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen
breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and
with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments;
therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.

16:5 and he shall take of the congregation of the children of israel
two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt
offering.

16:6 and aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is
for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.

16:7 and he shall take the two goats, and present them before the lord
at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

16:8 and aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the
lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat.

16:9 and aaron shall bring the goat upon which the lord's lot fell,
and offer him for a sin offering.

16:10 but the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall
be presented alive before the lord, to make an atonement with him, and
to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.

16:11 and aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is
for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his
house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for
himself: 16:12 and he shall take a censer full of burning coals of
fire from off the altar before the lord, and his hands full of sweet
incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail: 16:13 and he shall
put the incense upon the fire before the lord, that the cloud of the
incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he
die not: 16:14 and he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and
sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before
the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven
times.

16:15 then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the
people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as
he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy
seat, and before the mercy seat: 16:16 and he shall make an atonement
for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of
israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so
shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth
among them in the midst of their uncleanness.

16:17 and there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation
when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come
out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household,
and for all the congregation of israel.

16:18 and he shall go out unto the altar that is before the lord, and
make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock,
and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar
round about.

16:19 and he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven
times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the
children of israel.

16:20 and when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and
the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the
live goat: 16:21 and aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of
the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children
of israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting
them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of
a fit man into the wilderness: 16:22 and the goat shall bear upon him
all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go
the goat in the wilderness.

16:23 and aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation,
and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went
into the holy place, and shall leave them there: 16:24 and he shall
wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments,
and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering
of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.

16:25 and the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.

16:26 and he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his
clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the
camp.

16:27 and the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin
offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy
place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in
the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.

16:28 and he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his
flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.

16:29 and this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the
seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your
souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country,
or a stranger that sojourneth among you: 16:30 for on that day shall
the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be
clean from all your sins before the lord.

16:31 it shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict
your souls, by a statute for ever.

16:32 and the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall
consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead,
shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the
holy garments: 16:33 and he shall make an atonement for the holy
sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the
congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement for
the priests, and for all the people of the congregation.

16:34 and this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an
atonement for the children of israel for all their sins once a year.
and he did as the lord commanded moses.

17:1 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 17:2 speak unto aaron, and
unto his sons, and unto all the children of israel, and say unto them;
this is the thing which the lord hath commanded, saying, 17:3 what man
soever there be of the house of israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb,
or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp, 17:4 and
bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
to offer an offering unto the lord before the tabernacle of the lord;
blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man
shall be cut off from among his people: 17:5 to the end that the
children of israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the
open field, even that they may bring them unto the lord, unto the door
of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them
for peace offerings unto the lord.

17:6 and the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the
lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the
fat for a sweet savour unto the lord.

17:7 and they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after
whom they have gone a whoring. this shall be a statute for ever unto
them throughout their generations.

17:8 and thou shalt say unto them, whatsoever man there be of the
house of israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that
offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice, 17:9 and bringeth it not unto
the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the
lord; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.

17:10 and whatsoever man there be of the house of israel, or of the
strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; i
will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will
cut him off from among his people.

17:11 for the life of the flesh is in the blood: and i have given it
to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is
the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.

17:12 therefore i said unto the children of israel, no soul of you
shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you
eat blood.

17:13 and whatsoever man there be of the children of israel, or of the
strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast
or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof,
and cover it with dust.

17:14 for it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life
thereof: therefore i said unto the children of israel, ye shall eat
the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the
blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.

17:15 and every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that
which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or
a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in
water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.

17:16 but if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear
his iniquity.

18:1 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 18:2 speak unto the
children of israel, and say unto them, i am the lord your god.

18:3 after the doings of the land of egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye
not do: and after the doings of the land of canaan, whither i bring
you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.

18:4 ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk
therein: i am the lord your god.

18:5 ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a
man do, he shall live in them: i am the lord.

18:6 none of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to
uncover their nakedness: i am the lord.

18:7 the nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother,
shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her
nakedness.

18:8 the nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is
thy father's nakedness.

18:9 the nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or
daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad,
even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.

18:10 the nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's
daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is
thine own nakedness.

18:11 the nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy
father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

18:12 thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she
is thy father's near kinswoman.

18:13 thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for
she is thy mother's near kinswoman.

18:14 thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother,
thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.

18:15 thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she
is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

18:16 thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it
is thy brother's nakedness.

18:17 thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her
daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her
daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near
kinswomen: it is wickedness.

18:18 neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to
uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.

18:19 also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her
nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.

18:20 moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife,
to defile thyself with her.

18:21 and thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to
molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy god: i am the lord.

18:22 thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is
abomination.

18:23 neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself
therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down
thereto: it is confusion.

18:24 defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all
these the nations are defiled which i cast out before you: 18:25 and
the land is defiled: therefore i do visit the iniquity thereof upon
it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.

18:26 ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall
not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation,
nor any stranger that sojourneth among you: 18:27 (for all these
abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and
the land is defiled;) 18:28 that the land spue not you out also, when
ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you.

18:29 for whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the
souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people.

18:30 therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any
one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and
that ye defile not yourselves therein: i am the lord your god.

19:1 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 19:2 speak unto all the
congregation of the children of israel, and say unto them, ye shall be
holy: for i the lord your god am holy.

19:3 ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my
sabbaths: i am the lord your god.

19:4 turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: i am
the lord your god.

19:5 and if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the lord, ye
shall offer it at your own will.

19:6 it shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow:
and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the
fire.

19:7 and if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it
shall not be accepted.

19:8 therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity,
because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the lord: and that soul
shall be cut off from among his people.

19:9 and when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly
reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings
of thy harvest.

19:10 and thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather
every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and
stranger: i am the lord your god.

19:11 ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to
another.

19:12 and ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou
profane the name of thy god: i am the lord.

19:13 thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the wages
of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the
morning.

19:14 thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before
the blind, but shalt fear thy god: i am the lord.

19:15 ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not
respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty:
but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.

19:16 thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people:
neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour; i am the
lord.

19:17 thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in
any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.

19:18 thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children
of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: i am the
lord.

19:19 ye shall keep my statutes. thou shalt not let thy cattle gender
with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed:
neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.

19:20 and whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid,
betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given
her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because
she was not free.

19:21 and he shall bring his trespass offering unto the lord, unto the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass
offering.

19:22 and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of
the trespass offering before the lord for his sin which he hath done:
and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.

19:23 and when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all
manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as
uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it
shall not be eaten of.

19:24 but in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to
praise the lord withal.

19:25 and in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it
may yield unto you the increase thereof: i am the lord your god.

19:26 ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use
enchantment, nor observe times.

19:27 ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou
mar the corners of thy beard.

19:28 ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor
print any marks upon you: i am the lord.

19:29 do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest
the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.

19:30 ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: i am the
lord.

19:31 regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after
wizards, to be defiled by them: i am the lord your god.

19:32 thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of
the old man, and fear thy god: i am the lord.

19:33 and if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not
vex him.

19:34 but the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one
born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were
strangers in the land of egypt: i am the lord your god.

19:35 ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in
weight, or in measure.

19:36 just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall
ye have: i am the lord your god, which brought you out of the land of
egypt.

19:37 therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my
judgments, and do them: i am the lord.

20:1 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 20:2 again, thou shalt say
to the children of israel, whosoever he be of the children of israel,
or of the strangers that sojourn in israel, that giveth any of his
seed unto molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the
land shall stone him with stones.

20:3 and i will set my face against that man, and will cut him off
from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto molech,
to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.

20:4 and if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from
the man, when he giveth of his seed unto molech, and kill him not:
20:5 then i will set my face against that man, and against his family,
and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit
whoredom with molech, from among their people.

20:6 and the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits,
and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, i will even set my face
against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.

20:7 sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for i am the lord
your god.

20:8 and ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: i am the lord which
sanctify you.

20:9 for every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be
surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his
blood shall be upon him.

20:10 and the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife,
even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the
adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.

20:11 and the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his
father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their
blood shall be upon them.

20:12 and if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall
surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall
be upon them.

20:13 if a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both
of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to
death; their blood shall be upon them.

20:14 and if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they
shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no
wickedness among you.

20:15 and if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death:
and ye shall slay the beast.

20:16 and if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto,
thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to
death; their blood shall be upon them.

20:17 and if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or
his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his
nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the
sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he
shall bear his iniquity.

20:18 and if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and
shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she
hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be
cut off from among their people.

20:19 and thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister,
nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall
bear their iniquity.

20:20 and if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered
his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die
childless.

20:21 and if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean
thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be
childless.

20:22 ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments,
and do them: that the land, whither i bring you to dwell therein, spue
you not out.

20:23 and ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which i cast
out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore i
abhorred them.

20:24 but i have said unto you, ye shall inherit their land, and i
will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and
honey: i am the lord your god, which have separated you from other
people.

20:25 ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and
unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make
your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living
thing that creepeth on the ground, which i have separated from you as
unclean.

20:26 and ye shall be holy unto me: for i the lord am holy, and have
severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.

20:27 a man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a
wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with
stones: their blood shall be upon them.

21:1 and the lord said unto moses, speak unto the priests the sons of
aaron, and say unto them, there shall none be defiled for the dead
among his people: 21:2 but for his kin, that is near unto him, that
is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his
daughter, and for his brother.

21:3 and for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath
had no husband; for her may he be defiled.

21:4 but he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his
people, to profane himself.

21:5 they shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they
shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their
flesh.

21:6 they shall be holy unto their god, and not profane the name of
their god: for the offerings of the lord made by fire, and the bread
of their god, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.

21:7 they shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither
shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto
his god.

21:8 thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of
thy god: he shall be holy unto thee: for i the lord, which sanctify
you, am holy.

21:9 and the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing
the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.

21:10 and he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose
head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on
the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes; 21:11
neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his
father, or for his mother; 21:12 neither shall he go out of the
sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his god; for the crown of the
anointing oil of his god is upon him: i am the lord.

21:13 and he shall take a wife in her virginity.

21:14 a widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these
shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to
wife.

21:15 neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for i the
lord do sanctify him.

21:16 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 21:17 speak unto aaron,
saying, whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any
blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his god.

21:18 for whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not
approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any
thing superfluous, 21:19 or a man that is brokenfooted, or
brokenhanded, 21:20 or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish
in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken; 21:21
no man that hath a blemish of the seed of aaron the priest shall come
nigh to offer the offerings of the lord made by fire: he hath a
blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his god.

21:22 he shall eat the bread of his god, both of the most holy, and of
the holy.

21:23 only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the
altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries:
for i the lord do sanctify them.

21:24 and moses told it unto aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the
children of israel.

22:1 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 22:2 speak unto aaron and
to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the
children of israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those
things which they hallow unto me: i am the lord.

22:3 say unto them, whosoever he be of all your seed among your
generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of
israel hallow unto the lord, having his uncleanness upon him, that
soul shall be cut off from my presence: i am the lord.

22:4 what man soever of the seed of aaron is a leper, or hath a
running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean.
and whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man
whose seed goeth from him; 22:5 or whosoever toucheth any creeping
thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take
uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath; 22:6 the soul which hath
touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the
holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.

22:7 and when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward
eat of the holy things; because it is his food.

22:8 that which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not
eat to defile himself therewith; i am the lord.

22:9 they shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for
it, and die therefore, if they profane it: i the lord do sanctify
them.

22:10 there shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of
the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.

22:11 but if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of
it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.

22:12 if the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she
may not eat of an offering of the holy things.

22:13 but if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have
no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth,
she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall be no stranger eat
thereof.

22:14 and if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall
put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest
with the holy thing.

22:15 and they shall not profane the holy things of the children of
israel, which they offer unto the lord; 22:16 or suffer them to bear
the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for i the
lord do sanctify them.

22:17 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 22:18 speak unto aaron,
and to his sons, and unto all the children of israel, and say unto
them, whatsoever he be of the house of israel, or of the strangers in
israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his
freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the lord for a burnt
offering; 22:19 ye shall offer at your own will a male without
blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.

22:20 but whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it
shall not be acceptable for you.

22:21 and whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the
lord to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep,
it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.

22:22 blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or
scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the lord, nor make an offering
by fire of them upon the altar unto the lord.

22:23 either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or
lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering;
but for a vow it shall not be accepted.

22:24 ye shall not offer unto the lord that which is bruised, or
crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof
in your land.

22:25 neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your
god of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and
blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.

22:26 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 22:27 when a bullock, or
a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days
under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be
accepted for an offering made by fire unto the lord.

22:28 and whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her
young both in one day.

22:29 and when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the
lord, offer it at your own will.

22:30 on the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it
until the morrow: i am the lord.

22:31 therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: i am the
lord.

22:32 neither shall ye profane my holy name; but i will be hallowed
among the children of israel: i am the lord which hallow you, 22:33
that brought you out of the land of egypt, to be your god: i am the
lord.

23:1 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 23:2 speak unto the
children of israel, and say unto them, concerning the feasts of the
lord, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are
my feasts.

23:3 six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath
of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the
sabbath of the lord in all your dwellings.

23:4 these are the feasts of the lord, even holy convocations, which
ye shall proclaim in their seasons.

23:5 in the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the lord's
passover.

23:6 and on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of
unleavened bread unto the lord: seven days ye must eat unleavened
bread.

23:7 in the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do
no servile work therein.

23:8 but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord seven
days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no
servile work therein.

23:9 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 23:10 speak unto the
children of israel, and say unto them, when ye be come into the land
which i give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye
shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the
priest: 23:11 and he shall wave the sheaf before the lord, to be
accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall
wave it.

23:12 and ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb
without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the lord.

23:13 and the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine
flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the lord for a
sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the
fourth part of an hin.

23:14 and ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green
ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto
your god: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations
in all your dwellings.

23:15 and ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath,
from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven
sabbaths shall be complete: 23:16 even unto the morrow after the
seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new
meat offering unto the lord.

23:17 ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two
tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with
leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the lord.

23:18 and ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of
the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for
a burnt offering unto the lord, with their meat offering, and their
drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto
the lord.

23:19 then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering,
and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.

23:20 and the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits
for a wave offering before the lord, with the two lambs: they shall be
holy to the lord for the priest.

23:21 and ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an
holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: it
shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your
generations.

23:22 and when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make
clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither
shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them
unto the poor, and to the stranger: i am the lord your god.

23:23 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 23:24 speak unto the
children of israel, saying, in the seventh month, in the first day of
the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets,
an holy convocation.

23:25 ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an
offering made by fire unto the lord.

23:26 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 23:27 also on the tenth
day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall
be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and
offer an offering made by fire unto the lord.

23:28 and ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of
atonement, to make an atonement for you before the lord your god.

23:29 for whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that
same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.

23:30 and whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day,
the same soul will i destroy from among his people.

23:31 ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever
throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

23:32 it shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict
your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto
even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.

23:33 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 23:34 speak unto the
children of israel, saying, the fifteenth day of this seventh month
shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the lord.

23:35 on the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no
servile work therein.

23:36 seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the
lord: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye
shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord: it is a solemn
assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.

23:37 these are the feasts of the lord, which ye shall proclaim to be
holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the lord, a
burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings,
every thing upon his day: 23:38 beside the sabbaths of the lord, and
beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your
freewill offerings, which ye give unto the lord.

23:39 also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have
gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the lord
seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day
shall be a sabbath.

23:40 and ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly
trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and
willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the lord your god
seven days.

23:41 and ye shall keep it a feast unto the lord seven days in the
year.

it shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate
it in the seventh month.

23:42 ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are israelites
born shall dwell in booths: 23:43 that your generations may know that
i made the children of israel to dwell in booths, when i brought them
out of the land of egypt: i am the lord your god.

23:44 and moses declared unto the children of israel the feasts of the
lord.

24:1 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 24:2 command the children
of israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the
light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.

24:3 without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the
congregation, shall aaron order it from the evening unto the morning
before the lord continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your
generations.

24:4 he shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the
lord continually.

24:5 and thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof:
two tenth deals shall be in one cake.

24:6 and thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure
table before the lord.

24:7 and thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may
be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the
lord.

24:8 every sabbath he shall set it in order before the lord
continually, being taken from the children of israel by an everlasting
covenant.

24:9 and it shall be aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in
the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the
lord made by fire by a perpetual statute.

24:10 and the son of an israelitish woman, whose father was an
egyptian, went out among the children of israel: and this son of the
israelitish woman and a man of israel strove together in the camp;
24:11 and the israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the lord,
and cursed. and they brought him unto moses: (and his mother's name
was shelomith, the daughter of dibri, of the tribe of dan:) 24:12 and
they put him in ward, that the mind of the lord might be shewed them.

24:13 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 24:14 bring forth him
that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay
their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.

24:15 and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel, saying,
whosoever curseth his god shall bear his sin.

24:16 and he that blasphemeth the name of the lord, he shall surely be
put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as
well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth
the name of the lord, shall be put to death.

24:17 and he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.

24:18 and he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.

24:19 and if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done,
so shall it be done to him; 24:20 breach for breach, eye for eye,
tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be
done to him again.

24:21 and he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that
killeth a man, he shall be put to death.

24:22 ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as
for one of your own country: for i am the lord your god.

24:23 and moses spake to the children of israel, that they should
bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with
stones. and the children of israel did as the lord commanded moses.

25:1 and the lord spake unto moses in mount sinai, saying, 25:2 speak
unto the children of israel, and say unto them, when ye come into the
land which i give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the
lord.

25:3 six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt
prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; 25:4 but in the
seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for
the lord: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.

25:5 that which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt
not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a
year of rest unto the land.

25:6 and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and
for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for
thy stranger that sojourneth with thee.

25:7 and for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall
all the increase thereof be meat.

25:8 and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven
times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall
be unto thee forty and nine years.

25:9 then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the
tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make
the trumpet sound throughout all your land.

25:10 and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty
throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be
a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession,
and ye shall return every man unto his family.

25:11 a jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow,
neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes
in it of thy vine undressed.

25:12 for it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat
the increase thereof out of the field.

25:13 in the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his
possession.

25:14 and if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of
thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another: 25:15
according to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of
thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he
shall sell unto thee: 25:16 according to the multitude of years thou
shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of
years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number
of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.

25:17 ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear
thy god:for i am the lord your god.

25:18 wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do
them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.

25:19 and the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill,
and dwell therein in safety.

25:20 and if ye shall say, what shall we eat the seventh year? behold,
we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase: 25:21 then i will
command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring
forth fruit for three years.

25:22 and ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until
the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old
store.

25:23 the land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for
ye are strangers and sojourners with me.

25:24 and in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a
redemption for the land.

25:25 if thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his
possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he
redeem that which his brother sold.

25:26 and if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to
redeem it; 25:27 then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and
restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may
return unto his possession.

25:28 but if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is
sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the
year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return
unto his possession.

25:29 and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may
redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may
he redeem it.

25:30 and if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then
the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to
him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in
the jubile.

25:31 but the houses of the villages which have no wall round about
them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be
redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.

25:32 notwithstanding the cities of the levites, and the houses of the
cities of their possession, may the levites redeem at any time.

25:33 and if a man purchase of the levites, then the house that was
sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of
jubile: for the houses of the cities of the levites are their
possession among the children of israel.

25:34 but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;
for it is their perpetual possession.

25:35 and if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee;
then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a
sojourner; that he may live with thee.

25:36 take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy god; that
thy brother may live with thee.

25:37 thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy
victuals for increase.

25:38 i am the lord your god, which brought you forth out of the land
of egypt, to give you the land of canaan, and to be your god.

25:39 and if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be
sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:
25:40 but as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with
thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.

25:41 and then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children
with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the
possession of his fathers shall he return.

25:42 for they are my servants, which i brought forth out of the land
of egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.

25:43 thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy
god.

25:44 both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,
shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy
bondmen and bondmaids.

25:45 moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among
you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you,
which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.

25:46 and ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after
you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for
ever: but over your brethren the children of israel, ye shall not rule
one over another with rigour.

25:47 and if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother
that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or
sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family: 25:48
after that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren
may redeem him: 25:49 either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem
him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him;
or if he be able, he may redeem himself.

25:50 and he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that
he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale
shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of
an hired servant shall it be with him.

25:51 if there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall
give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was
bought for.

25:52 and if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then
he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give
him again the price of his redemption.

25:53 and as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the
other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.

25:54 and if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out
in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.

25:55 for unto me the children of israel are servants; they are my
servants whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt: i am the lord
your god.

26:1 ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up
a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your
land, to bow down unto it: for i am the lord your god.

26:2 ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: i am the
lord.

26:3 if ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;
26:4 then i will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield
her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.

26:5 and your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage
shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the
full, and dwell in your land safely.

26:6 and i will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and
none shall make you afraid: and i will rid evil beasts out of the
land, neither shall the sword go through your land.

26:7 and ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you
by the sword.

26:8 and five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you
shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before
you by the sword.

26:9 for i will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and
multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.

26:10 and ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of
the new.

26:11 and i set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor
you.

26:12 and i will walk among you, and will be your god, and ye shall be
my people.

26:13 i am the lord your god, which brought you forth out of the land
of egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and i have broken the
bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.

26:14 but if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these
commandments; 26:15 and if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your
soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments,
but that ye break my covenant: 26:16 i also will do this unto you; i
will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague,
that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall
sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.

26:17 and i will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before
your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall
flee when none pursueth you.

26:18 and if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then i will
punish you seven times more for your sins.

26:19 and i will break the pride of your power; and i will make your
heaven as iron, and your earth as brass: 26:20 and your strength shall
be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither
shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.

26:21 and if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; i
will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.

26:22 i will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of
your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number;
and your high ways shall be desolate.

26:23 and if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will
walk contrary unto me; 26:24 then will i also walk contrary unto you,
and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.

26:25 and i will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel
of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities,
i will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into
the hand of the enemy.

26:26 and when i have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall
bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread
again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.

26:27 and if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk
contrary unto me; 26:28 then i will walk contrary unto you also in
fury; and i, even i, will chastise you seven times for your sins.

26:29 and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your
daughters shall ye eat.

26:30 and i will destroy your high places, and cut down your images,
and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul
shall abhor you.

26:31 and i will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries
unto desolation, and i will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.

26:32 and i will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies
which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.

26:33 and i will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a
sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities
waste.

26:34 then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth
desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land
rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.

26:35 as long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not
rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.

26:36 and upon them that are left alive of you i will send a faintness
into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a
shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a
sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.

26:37 and they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword,
when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your
enemies.

26:38 and ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your
enemies shall eat you up.

26:39 and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity
in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers
shall they pine away with them.

26:40 if they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their
fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and
that also they have walked contrary unto me; 26:41 and that i also
have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of
their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they
then accept of the punishment of their iniquity: 26:42 then will i
remember my covenant with jacob, and also my covenant with isaac, and
also my covenant with abraham will i remember; and i will remember the
land.

26:43 the land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her
sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept
of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they
despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.

26:44 and yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies,
i will not cast them away, neither will i abhor them, to destroy them
utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for i am the lord their
god.

26:45 but i will for their sakes remember the covenant of their
ancestors, whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt in the sight
of the heathen, that i might be their god: i am the lord.

26:46 these are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the lord
made between him and the children of israel in mount sinai by the hand
of moses.

27:1 and the lord spake unto moses, saying, 27:2 speak unto the
children of israel, and say unto them, when a man shall make a
singular vow, the persons shall be for the lord by thy estimation.

27:3 and thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old
even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels
of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

27:4 and if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty
shekels.

27:5 and if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then
thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female
ten shekels.

27:6 and if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy
estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the
female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.

27:7 and if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male,
then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten
shekels.

27:8 but if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present
himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according
to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.

27:9 and if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the
lord, all that any man giveth of such unto the lord shall be holy.

27:10 he shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad
for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and
the exchange thereof shall be holy.

27:11 and if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a
sacrifice unto the lord, then he shall present the beast before the
priest: 27:12 and the priest shall value it, whether it be good or
bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.

27:13 but if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part
thereof unto thy estimation.

27:14 and when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the
lord, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as
the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.

27:15 and if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he
shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and
it shall be his.

27:16 and if a man shall sanctify unto the lord some part of a field
of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed
thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of
silver.

27:17 if he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to
thy estimation it shall stand.

27:18 but if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest
shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain,
even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy
estimation.

27:19 and if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it,
then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto
it, and it shall be assured to him.

27:20 and if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the
field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.

27:21 but the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy
unto the lord, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the
priest's.

27:22 and if a man sanctify unto the lord a field which he hath
bought, which is not of the fields of his possession; 27:23 then the
priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto
the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that
day, as a holy thing unto the lord.

27:24 in the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of
whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did
belong.

27:25 and all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the
sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.

27:26 only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the lord's
firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is
the lord's.

27:27 and if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it
according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it
thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to
thy estimation.

27:28 notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto
the lord of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field
of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is
most holy unto the lord.

27:29 none devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed;
but shall surely be put to death.

27:30 and all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land,
or of the fruit of the tree, is the lord's: it is holy unto the lord.

27:31 and if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall
add thereto the fifth part thereof.

27:32 and concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of
whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the
lord.

27:33 he shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he
change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change
thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.

27:34 these are the commandments, which the lord commanded moses for
the children of israel in mount sinai.
